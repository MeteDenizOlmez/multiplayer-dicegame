# multiplayer-dicegame
This is a simple dice-game project that I had made which I later adapted using Sockets to add multiplayer functionality in Python.
I created this to test some of the python sockets communication functionalities to communicate between two client programs and a server. This currently works on localhost, however with portforwarding on your router enabled, can be played over the internet as well!

#Here is a video, showcasing how to play the dicegame
(NOTE: both the two clients and the server are on localhost in this example, to use over the internet, your public IP address must be reachable and in your router settings, the corresponding port e.g. 25565 in this case, should be port forwarded.)
