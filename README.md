# multiplayer-dicegame
This is a simple dice-game project that I had made which I later adapted using Sockets to add multiplayer functionality in Python.
I created this to test some of the python sockets communication functionalities to communicate between two client programs and a server. This currently works on localhost, however with portforwarding on your router enabled, can be played over the internet as well!
